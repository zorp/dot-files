# WHAT IS
This is my dot files inspired from various places originally copied from my good mate ranza, https://github.com/ranza

I work on OS-X everything is tested to work in this environment.

# DEPENDENCIES
My dot files depend on some packages installed with brew.

- First get and install brew, it's really easy. http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/
- Install some neat stuff (to be honest I can't remember the exact dependencies)
 - bash-completion
 - git-extras
 - hub
 
# INSTALL

- Clone into yout home dir
- Setup symlinks to:
 - .gitconfig -> .dot-files/gitconfig
 - .inputrc -> .dot-files/inputrc

 - .bashrc -> .dot-files/bashrc
 - .bin -> .dot-files/bin/
